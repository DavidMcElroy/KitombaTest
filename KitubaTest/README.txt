The Problem I chose to solve was Problem #3.
the assumptions I have made in regards to this problem are:
- input file will only have one plateau
- input for coorinates will always be space separated
- there can be as many rovers as the user wants.
- rovers cannot leave the plateau.
- rovers placed outside the plateau will move to the closest place on the plateau.
- user can give more than one line of movement input.
- orientation is such that moving north is Y increaseing and east in X increasing



The problem solution requires java 1.8 to run.

to run, simply compile MarsLanding.java in comand Prompt (or terminal)

then call "java MarsLanding" with your Input file as an argument (input file should be placed in SRC folder). If no input file is passed in, then the original test will be run through input.txt.

the output will be saved into outputFile.txt in the src file.
